# GeOptimize
Geographical Optimization using PSO

## Setup/General Use
Using gradle for building and dependencies. A good tutorial is at https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/

If you don't have gradle installed, you can use the local gradle wrapper "gradlew" on Windows and Linux.

Gradle is configured entirely from the file "build.gradle"

### Commands

* gradle[w] tasks
* gradle[w] build
* gradle[w] run

An all-in-one jar file will also be built to build/lib for easy execution.

### Eclipse
If you're using eclipse run:

* gradle[w] eclipse

This will setup the eclipse project to find and include dependency JAR files for syntax highlighting.
